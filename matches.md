## Matches

### 1. High Confidence Match: David T. -> Maintenance Planner (K92 Mining)
*   **Match Score:** 95%
*   **Rationale:** 
    *   **Direct Role Match:** Candidate's current role is "Maintenance Planner", matching the job title exactly.
    *   **Skill Alignment:** Candidate lists "Maintenance Planning" and "SAP" as core skills, which are standard requirements for this role in mining.
    *   **Location Fit:** Candidate is in Goroka (Eastern Highlands), and K92 Mining is in the same region (Kainantu/Eastern Highlands), making logistics favorable.
    *   **Experience:** 12 years seniority suggests a strong fit for a mining planner role.
*   **Recommended Action:** Email David T. immediately with the K92 job link. Prioritize this candidate.

### 2. High Confidence Match: John K. -> Technician - Fitter (HEF) (K92 Mining)
*   **Match Score:** 90%
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Acronym Match:** The job title specifies "HEF", which stands for Heavy Equipment Fitter—John K.'s exact role.
    *   **Industry Fit:** John has mining experience ("Lihir Gold") and lists "Mining Safety", aligning perfectly with K92 Mining Inc.
    *   **Skill Alignment:** "Caterpillar Systems" and "Hydraulics" are critical for this position.
*   **Recommended Action:** SMS/Email John K. regarding the K92 opportunity. Highlight the mining context.

### 3. Medium Confidence Match: Sarah M. -> Sales Consultant (WR Carpenter)
*   **Match Score:** 75%
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Role Alignment:** "Sales Associate" to "Sales Consultant" is a natural progression or lateral move.
    *   **Skill Match:** "Customer Service" and "Point of Sale" are transferable.
    *   **Location:** Sarah is in Port Moresby. WR Carpenter has a major presence there (though specific job location needs confirmation, it is likely POM).
*   **Recommended Action:** Notify Sarah M. suggesting she apply for the Sales Consultant role.

### 4. Low/Speculative Match: Grace L. -> Debtors Clerk (WR Carpenter)
*   **Match Score:** 40%
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Transferable Skills:** Grace is an Admin Assistant with "Data Entry" and "Microsoft Office" skills. These are foundational for a Debtors Clerk, but she lacks specific finance/accounting keywords like "Invoicing" or "Reconciliation".
*   **Recommended Action:** Add to "Potential Pool" for Debtors Clerk if no specialized candidates exist.

## Unmatched Opportunities
*   **Service Advisor (WR Carpenter):** No strong candidate match in current pool.
*   **Peter W. (Diesel Mechanic):** No direct open requisition, though could potentially backfill the Fitter role if requirements overlap (lower probability).
